## AI Usage

The Gemini CLI was used to assist in the development of this project. The following is a summary of the AI's contributions:

*   **Initial Project Setup:** The AI was used to set up the initial project structure, including the creation of the `main.py`, `src/`, and `tests/` directories.
*   **Data Parsing:** The AI was used to parse the initial data for the `KALOS_BOSSES` dictionary from a raw text format.
*   **Code Generation:** The AI was used to generate the code for the `api_client.py` module, which fetches data from the PokéAPI.
*   **Code Refactoring and Cleanup:** The AI was used to refactor and clean up the code in the `main.py` and `src/analyzer.py` modules.
*   **Documentation:** The AI was used to generate the `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` files.
*   **Git Management:** The AI was used to manage the git repository, including creating the `.gitignore` file and committing changes.
*   **Category Renaming:** The AI was used to rename the categories in the `KALOS_BOSSES` dictionary to match the "split" names.
*   **Project Cleanup:** The AI was used to clean up the project before the first push, including creating a `.gitignore` file, reviewing the `requirements.txt` file, and reviewing the code for clarity and consistency.
